In the 2025 Antalya leg of the World Archery World Cup there new experimental rounds
were used.

Colloquially referred to as the WA660 rounds these were shot on the same size faces
and at the same distances as other world cup legs, but featured two key differences:

- 60 arrows per round rather than the usual 72, and
- 11-zone scoring where the X-ring scores 11 points, rather than 10-zone scoring.

This repository takes a look at the results to see how these changes affected some
aspects of the competition.
